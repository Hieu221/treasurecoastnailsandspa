- ✅ Images and other assets
- ✅ Fast, cheap, easy to host
- ✅ Perfect for: portfolios, business sites, blogs

**Dynamic Website:**
- ❌ Needs server-side code (PHP, Node.js, etc.)
- ❌ Needs a database
- ❌ More complex setup
- ❌ Used for: social media, e-commerce, apps

**Your nail salon website is static - which makes it perfect for Vercel!**

## 🎓 Quick Checklist

Before deploying:

- [ ] All images are in the `images/` folder
- [ ] All file paths are correct (e.g., `src="images/photo.jpg"`)
- [ ] Test the website locally (open `index.html` in browser)
- [ ] Everything looks good? You're ready to deploy!

## 📝 No Special Configuration Needed!

Unlike some hosting services, Vercel doesn't require:
- ❌ No configuration files needed

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Images not showing after deployment?**

- Make sure `images/` folder is included in upload

**Styles not loading?**
- Make sure `styles.css` is in the same folder as `index.html`
- Check the `<link>` tag in HTML: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">`

**JavaScript not working?**

- Check the `<script>` tag in HTML: `<script src="script.js"></script>`
